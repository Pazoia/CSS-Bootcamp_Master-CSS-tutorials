        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

        <p class="lesson-description">
            In this lesson we explore how to use CSS selectors.
        </p>
        <ul class="lesson-notes">
            <li>
                Precedence in order of importance: <br>
                element with parent element has higher precedence than just the element. <br>
                ul li {} will override li {} <br><br>
                class selection has higher precedence than element selection. <br>
                .item {} will override ul {} <br><br>
                id selection has the highest precedence than all the others. <br>
                #item {} will override .beer {} <br>
                #item {} will override h1 {} <br>
                #item {} will override ul li {} 

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                More than one selector can be used in one line, <br>
                for example if both h1 and h2 require the same CSS styling <br>
                the block of code would look like: <br><br>
                h1, h2 { <br>
                    // styling code inside <br>
                }
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To access an element using it's class to select it, <br>
                type .class followed by curly braces. This will affect all <br>
                elements with this class. <br><br>
                h1 class="wine" <br>
                li class="wine" <br><br>
                .wine { <br>
                    // styling code inside <br>
                } <br><br>
                In this case both h1 and li would have the same styling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To access an element using it's id to select it, <br>
                type #id followed by curly braces. This will affect all <br>
                elements with this id. <br><br>
                h1 id="beer" <br>
                li id="beer" <br><br>
                #beer { <br>
                    // styling code inside <br>
                } <br><br>
                Although the id would also use the same styling for both <br>
                scenarios like in the case of the class, it is recomended that <br>
                id is to be used for an individual element styling, whilst class <br>
                is to be used to style various elements the same way.
            </li>
        </ul>
